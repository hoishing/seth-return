## Motivation

When discussing or seeking advice based on the Seth Material, it is often inevitable for personal feelings and opinions to become intertwined with the interpretation of the materials. 

Therefore, our objective is to develop a chat bot that utilizes the original Seth Material as its corpus, providing users with an experience akin to engaging in direct conversation with Seth. 
The aim is to incorporate Seth's philosophy, vocabulary, and speaking style in order to simulate an authentic interaction.
